# SOLID DESIGN PRINCIPLES

# Issue 4:
# Let's include a two-factor authentication inside the PaymentProcessor class.

# The issue here is that defining a generic interface like the PaymentProcessor to do multiples things
# that are not applicable to subclasses.

# This violates the interfae segregation principle, because not all subclasses support two-factor authentication.

# Interface segregation principle says:
# It is better, if you have have several specific interfaces as opposed to one general purpose insterface.
