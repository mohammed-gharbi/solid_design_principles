# SOLID DESIGN PRINCIPLES

# Issue 5:
# Dependency inversion principle means:
# that our classes should depend on abstractions and not in concrete subclasses.

# In this code, this is already an isue, because the PaymentProcessor depending on the sms authorizer
# what about if we want to add another type of authorizers, like not a robot, we can't use the SMSAuthentication.
